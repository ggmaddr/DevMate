## Problem Statement  
A major component of the software development cycle is debugging and error tracking. Errors, many of them, are an inevitability in the development process and when handled incorrectly can lead to a domino effect of other issues. 

As of now there are a wide variety of cloud-based issue tracking software that come with the same security vulnerabilities as all other cloud applications, as well as follow a common trend of showing ads and locking their full features behind paywalls 

For developers and enthusiasts, a private tracking system is of great benefit as they are free to develop their projects without fear of their ideas and implementations being leaked. 

Rather than storing bugs on a simple text file, or even a piece of paper, an application that automizes the issue-tracking process would make the development process much smoother.
